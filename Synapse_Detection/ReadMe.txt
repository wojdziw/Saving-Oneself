Working TreeBagger! (I think...)
I've spent ages commenting everything to make it clear. If still not sure message me.
If you've added new feature/changed variables then:

1) Run TREEBAG 
2) Run Validate
3) Look at the F1 score


This is probably the most I can do, possibly more on monday.
Please add whatever you can wherever you can

To Do:
1) The pre processing (FirstStage, SecondStage) could still use some work, however it's very hard to visualise the effect changing
variables/adding process is doing. So be careful and test frequently.

2) Add features! The ones left to be added really, are processes on the real image such as greydetect(). Add these as functions
which need to be called in trainer0, trainer1 and Tester.
